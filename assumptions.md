- The character starts at full health
- After the game is lost, the game will show the user a loss screen
- The game is paused when the user is shopping at the hero's castle (i.e they can't get attacked while shopping)
- Multiple enemies cannot be on the same tile
- A building cannot be placed ontop of another building
- The user cannot equip more than 1 equipment of each type (i.e they can't equip 3 helmets)
