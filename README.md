# Loop Mania, a game written in Java
## Description
- Loop Mania is an application written in Java by our team of 4, where users are able to place buildings and equip items to aid a character which automatically moves around a cyclical map while battling enemies. This project was slowly built over 2 months, where we planned everything carefully through documents such as UML diagrams, project timelines and user interface designs.
