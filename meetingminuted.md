Meeting Minutes

Tuesday 22nd of June
Attendees: 
-	Michael Chidiac
-	Raymond Chung
-	Matthew Lau
-	Steven Long Nguyen
Points discussed: 
-	Milestone 1 task allocation
    -	Tasks with design emphasis such as user stories allocated to pairs.
    -	Easier tasks such as timetable allocated to single member.
In this meeting the team discussed basic allocation of the tasks in milestone 1 to each member and the general approach to teamwork for the rest of the project. We had decided to perform most tasks in pairs as to constantly have some form of pear review occurring as we worked whilst not having to arrange for everyone to review each other’s work. For milestone 1 we had chosen to have Michael work on the timetable, Steven to work on the user interface and both Matthew and Raymond working on the user stories. We decided to meet again in one weeks’ time to discuss the course of action for working on the UML diagram.

Points discussed: 
-	Progress on previous work
    -	All members finished previous work.
    -	User stories had to implement feedback from tutor.
-	UML diagram work allocation
    -	All members are available and will work on UML diagram together.
In the second meeting, we reviewed our progress for the work we had set from the previous meeting and decided to work on the UML diagram as a whole team since it was the last task needed for this milestone and it was also very important to our implementation. Furthermore, every member was available for the first half of the week, and we could easily arrange a session to work on it together.
